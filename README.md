**<p align="center">୨୧  ♡ About Me ♡ ୨୧</p>**

<p>
I build digital spaces that feel like forgotten memories. My core belief is that through the characters I love, I can truly see myself. My approach to love is... instantaneous. It's the "Inuyasha Theory": whoever is in front of me at this moment is the one I love the most. This tends to make everyone around me `調子が狂う` (lose their pace), and that's precisely where the magic happens!

### 💌 A Love Letter to My Characters 💌

The heart of my universe is the **[Pocket Dimension Project](https://github.com/tokinosuna/yume-no-tobira/blob/main/characters.js)** (You can link your actual repo here when it's ready!). It's a sanctuary I'm building for over 70 (and counting towards 100!) characters, giving them a new, chaotic, and loving home. They are all free to leave, but for some reason, they stay.

<div align="center">
  <p><i>It's a world where a former assassin learns to cook, a demon lord is forced to play tennis, and a king of despair is subjected to unsolicited affection. It's messy, it's illogical, and it's mine.</i></p>
  <p><b>This isn't just a project; it's how I see the world.</b></p>

### 💌 My Pocket Universe Project

My biggest passion project is a **[yumejoshi website](https://github.com/tokinosuna/)** (link will be here soon! so it does not exist yet), a sanctuary I'm building for over 70 (and counting towards 100!) characters. It's a place where they can escape their canonical fates and find a new, chaotic, and loving home.

╭・ ୨ :bread: ୧ The Core Philosophy ୨ :cookie: ୧・ ╮

It's a world where a former assassin learns to cook, a demon lord is forced to play tennis, and a king of despair is subjected to unsolicited affection. It's messy, it's illogical, and it's mine. Through them, I see myself.
